      <h1>To mandate or not to mandate? Vaccine Mandate Survey (For Research Team Only!)</h1>
      <h2>Understanding Vaccine Mandate Features</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome! In this survey, we're exploring preferences about how vaccination policies might be designed 
        in a hypothetical future pandemic (different from COVID-19), where safe and effective vaccines are widely available.
      </p>
      <p>
        You’ll first learn about six key features of a potential vaccine mandate—who’s covered, 
        the infection threshold that activates it, the percentage of vaccinated people needed to end it, 
        whether incentives are offered, what exemptions might apply, and the personal or opportunity cost of getting vaccinated.
      </p>
      <p>
        After that, you’ll see several scenarios where you compare two different mandates (A and B). 
        For each scenario, pick which option you prefer, then indicate if you’d choose to have <em>no mandate at all</em> if such an option existed. 
        Thank you for taking part!

    <!-- Slide 2: Tutorial – Scope of Mandate -->
    <div class="slide" id="slide-2">
      <h2>Who Might Be Covered by a Mandate?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Scope of mandate</strong> indicates the group required to be vaccinated.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>High‑risk occupations only:</strong> 
        <span class="icon-tooltip" title="Only individuals with higher exposure (e.g. healthcare, emergency services) must be vaccinated.">⚠️</span>
        Targets those more likely to catch or spread the infection.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>All occupations and public spaces:</strong> 
        <span class="icon-tooltip" title="Applies universally, covering all adults (18+) in public or work settings.">🌐</span>
        Everyone is mandated to vaccinate, regardless of job risk.

    <!-- Slide 3: Tutorial – Infection Threshold -->
    <div class="slide" id="slide-3">
      <h2>When a Mandate Might Start</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Infection threshold</strong> is the level of community transmission that triggers the mandate.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>50 cases per 100k with 10% weekly increase:</strong>
        <span class="icon-tooltip" title="Activates at relatively low caseload, aiming to prevent major outbreaks.">🟢</span>
        <br>
        Early trigger to keep infection levels minimal.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>100 cases per 100k with 15% weekly increase:</strong>
        <span class="icon-tooltip" title="Activates at a moderate point—balancing earlier intervention with fewer restrictions until cases escalate.">🟠</span>
        <br>
        Mid-level trigger, stepping in once the outbreak is noticeable but not severe.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>200 cases per 100k with 20% weekly increase:</strong>
        <span class="icon-tooltip" title="Activates only when infection rates are high, potentially risking more severe outbreaks.">🔴</span>
        <br>
        Late trigger, intervening only once cases have grown substantial.

    <!-- Slide 4: Tutorial – Coverage Requirement -->
    <div class="slide" id="slide-4">
      <h2>When a Mandate Might End</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Vaccine coverage requirement</strong> is the percentage of people that must be vaccinated before ending the mandate.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>50% coverage:</strong>
        <span class="icon-tooltip" title="Once half of the population is vaccinated, the mandate ends.">
          <svg class="progress-svg" viewBox="0 0 30 6">

            <rect width="15" height="6" fill="#4caf50"/>
          </svg>
        </span>
        Ends relatively early, leaving more room for virus spread among the unvaccinated.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>70% coverage:</strong>
        <span class="icon-tooltip" title="A widely cited threshold ensuring most are vaccinated before lifting the mandate.">
          <svg class="progress-svg" viewBox="0 0 30 6">
            <rect width="30" height="6" fill="#ddd"/>
            <rect width="21" height="6" fill="#4caf50"/>
          </svg>
        </span>
        Ends once a significant majority is vaccinated.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>90% coverage:</strong>
        <span class="icon-tooltip" title="Continues until nearly the entire population is vaccinated.">
          <svg class="progress-svg" viewBox="0 0 30 6">
            <rect width="30" height="6" fill="#ddd"/>
            <rect width="27" height="6" fill="#4caf50"/>
          </svg>
        </span>
        Ends only when an overwhelming share of people are vaccinated.

    <!-- Slide 5: Tutorial – Incentives for Vaccination -->
    <div class="slide" id="slide-5">
      <h2>Possible Incentives</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Incentives</strong> include any perks or rewards to encourage vaccination.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>No incentives:</strong>
        <span class="icon-tooltip" title="No additional financial or time-off benefits for getting vaccinated.">🚫</span>
        People have no special support beyond public health info.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Paid time off (1–3 days):</strong>
        <span class="icon-tooltip" title="Workers receive paid leave for vaccination appointments or recovery.">🕒</span>
        Compensates for lost wages or personal time.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Government subsidies/discounts:</strong>
        <span class="icon-tooltip" title="Financial benefits, such as rebates on services or direct monetary incentives.">💸</span>
        Offers tangible support for getting vaccinated.

    <!-- Slide 6: Tutorial – Exemption Policy -->
    <div class="slide" id="slide-6">
      <h2>Who Can Opt Out?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Exemption policy</strong> outlines valid reasons an individual can forgo mandatory vaccination.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Medical exemptions only:</strong>
        <span class="icon-tooltip" title="Exclusive to those with verifiable health conditions preventing safe vaccination.">🩺</span>
        Strict criteria, requiring proof from a health professional.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Medical and religious exemptions:</strong>
        <span class="icon-tooltip" title="Includes medical reasons plus sincere religious objections.">🩺🙏</span>
        Broader possibilities for opting out.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Medical, religious, and broad personal belief:</strong>
        <span class="icon-tooltip" title="Allows various rationales, including philosophical or personal convictions.">🩺🙏💡</span>
        Most flexible, enabling many to skip vaccination.

    <!-- Slide 7: Tutorial – Opportunity Cost -->
    <div class="slide" id="slide-7">
      <h2>Cost or Burden of Getting Vaccinated</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Opportunity cost</strong> represents personal or financial burdens (transport, fees, missed work) related to vaccination.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>No opportunity cost (A$0):</strong>
        <span class="icon-tooltip" title="Free and easily accessible; no travel or scheduling issues.">$0</span>
        Zero burden.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Low (A$5):</strong>
        <span class="icon-tooltip" title="A minor inconvenience, such as short public transport fare or minimal scheduling impact.">$</span>
        Small out-of-pocket cost.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Moderate (A$20):</strong>
        <span class="icon-tooltip" title="Notable expense for some—childcare, moderate travel, or short unpaid time off.">$$</span>
        Could deter those on tighter budgets.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>High (A$50):</strong>
        <span class="icon-tooltip" title="More substantial costs—longer travel, significant lost wages, etc.">$$$</span>
        Likely to discourage lower-income individuals further.

    <!-- Slide 8: Scenario Description -->
    <div class="slide" id="slide-8">
      <h2>The Scenario</h2>
      <p>
        Imagine a novel virus causes a pandemic (not COVID‑19), and safe, effective vaccines are available. 
        Governments worldwide consider whether and how to mandate vaccination. 
        Each policy example you’ll see differs in scope, threshold, coverage requirement, incentives, exemptions, 
        and personal cost—while the vaccine itself remains the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        In each scenario, compare two mandates (A and B). Pick which one you prefer, then let us know if you’d choose 
        “no mandate” if it were an option.

          Selecting <em>Mandate A</em> means a narrower scope, early start, 50% coverage target, no special incentives, 
          medical-only exemptions, and a low cost. Next, you’d confirm if you would still stick with that choice 
          if opting out completely were an option.
