      <h1>To mandate or not to mandate? Vaccine Mandate Survey (For Research Team Only!)</h1>
      <h2>Understanding Vaccine Mandate Features</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome! In this survey, we're exploring opinions about potential vaccination policies 
        in a hypothetical future pandemic (distinct from COVID-19) where safe and effective vaccines are widely available.
      </p>
      <p>
        We’re interested in your preferences for how a vaccine mandate could be designed—who it applies to, 
        when it should start, what it takes to end it, and so on. 
        First, you'll see tutorials about six key features that can vary between mandates. 
        Then, you'll go through several scenarios where you compare two possible policies and choose the one you prefer. 
        Finally, we’ll ask if you’d prefer <em>no mandate at all</em> if that were an option.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Important:</strong> This survey is for research purposes only. 
        Your individual responses will remain confidential, and the survey should take around 15 minutes to complete. 
        You can use any device (mobile, tablet, or desktop). 
        After completing, your answers will be emailed to the research team’s designated inbox. 
        We appreciate your time and input.

    <!-- Slide 2: Tutorial – Scope of Mandate -->
    <div class="slide" id="slide-2">
      <h2>Tutorial: Who Might Be Covered by a Mandate?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Scope of mandate</strong> describes which groups or individuals must be vaccinated under the policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>High‑risk occupations only:</strong> 
        <span class="icon-tooltip" title="Only individuals in frontline or high-exposure roles (e.g. healthcare, emergency services) are mandated.">⚠️</span>
        Applies only to those with an elevated risk of infection or transmission.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>All occupations and public spaces:</strong> 
        <span class="icon-tooltip" title="Everyone in public spaces or workplaces aged 18+ must get vaccinated.">🌐</span>
        Covers the entire adult population, with no occupation-based limit.

    <!-- Slide 3: Tutorial – Infection Threshold -->
    <div class="slide" id="slide-3">
      <h2>Tutorial: When a Mandate Might Start</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Infection threshold</strong> is the case level at which the mandate becomes active.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>50 cases per 100k with 10% weekly increase:</strong>
        <span class="icon-tooltip" title="Activates with relatively few cases, aiming to head off major outbreaks early.">🟢</span>
        <br>
        Early trigger to keep overall infection levels as low as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>100 cases per 100k with 15% weekly increase:</strong>
        <span class="icon-tooltip" title="Activates at a moderate stage—balancing early intervention with fewer restrictions until cases climb.">🟠</span>
        <br>
        Medium trigger, intervening once the outbreak is noticeable but not severe.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>200 cases per 100k with 20% weekly increase:</strong>
        <span class="icon-tooltip" title="Only triggers once infection rates are high, possibly risking larger outbreaks.">🔴</span>
        <br>
        Late trigger; waits until case numbers and transmission rates are significant.

    <!-- Slide 4: Tutorial – Coverage Requirement -->
    <div class="slide" id="slide-4">
      <h2>Tutorial: When a Mandate Might End</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Vaccine coverage requirement</strong> is the percentage of people who must be vaccinated before the mandate is lifted.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>50% coverage:</strong>
        <span class="icon-tooltip" title="Once half of the population is vaccinated, the mandate ends.">
          <svg class="progress-svg" viewBox="0 0 30 6">
            <rect width="30" height="6" fill="#ddd"/>
            <rect width="15" height="6" fill="#4caf50"/>
          </svg>
        </span>
        Ends earlier but may leave many still unvaccinated.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>70% coverage:</strong>
        <span class="icon-tooltip" title="Requires a significant majority to be vaccinated before the mandate stops.">
          <svg class="progress-svg" viewBox="0 0 30 6">
            <rect width="30" height="6" fill="#ddd"/>
            <rect width="21" height="6" fill="#4caf50"/>
          </svg>
        </span>
        Ends once roughly 70% have received the vaccine.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>90% coverage:</strong>
        <span class="icon-tooltip" title="The mandate continues until nearly everyone is vaccinated.">
          <svg class="progress-svg" viewBox="0 0 30 6">
            <rect width="30" height="6" fill="#ddd"/>
            <rect width="27" height="6" fill="#4caf50"/>
          </svg>
        </span>
        Ends only when 90% are vaccinated, aiming for very high population protection.

    <!-- Slide 5: Tutorial – Incentives for Vaccination -->
    <div class="slide" id="slide-5">
      <h2>Tutorial: Possible Incentives</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Incentives</strong> are rewards or benefits designed to encourage vaccination.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>No incentives:</strong>
        <span class="icon-tooltip" title="Individuals receive no rewards beyond general public health information.">🚫</span>
        No additional perks.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Paid time off (1–3 days):</strong>
        <span class="icon-tooltip" title="Workers get paid leave to accommodate vaccination appointments and possible side-effect recovery.">🕒</span>
        Reduces the economic impact of taking time off.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Government subsidies/discounts:</strong>
        <span class="icon-tooltip" title="Financial support or discounts for those who get vaccinated, e.g. rebate on health services.">💸</span>
        Monetary benefits offered by the government.

    <!-- Slide 6: Tutorial – Exemption Policy -->
    <div class="slide" id="slide-6">
      <h2>Tutorial: Who Can Opt Out?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Exemption policy</strong> outlines the acceptable reasons for not getting vaccinated.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Medical exemptions only:</strong>
        <span class="icon-tooltip" title="Strictly for those with health conditions that make vaccination inadvisable.">🩺</span>
        Very limited, requiring verified medical documents.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Medical and religious exemptions:</strong>
        <span class="icon-tooltip" title="Allows avoidance due to a certified health reason or sincere religious belief.">🩺🙏</span>
        Broader possibilities for opting out.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Medical, religious, and broad personal belief:</strong>
        <span class="icon-tooltip" title="Permits a wide range of rationales, including general personal objections.">🩺🙏💡</span>
        Most flexible, meaning higher potential for opting out.

    <!-- Slide 7: Tutorial – Opportunity Cost -->
    <div class="slide" id="slide-7">
      <h2>Tutorial: Cost or Burden of Getting Vaccinated</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Opportunity cost</strong> captures any personal or financial burden of receiving a vaccination, such as transport, time off work, or fees.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>No opportunity cost (A$0):</strong>
        <span class="icon-tooltip" title="Free and accessible; no travel or schedule disruptions.">$0</span>
        Zero hassle or expense.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Low (A$5):</strong>
        <span class="icon-tooltip" title="Minimal cost—e.g. cheap public transport or a quick local clinic.">$</span>
        Small inconvenience or fee.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Moderate (A$20):</strong>
        <span class="icon-tooltip" title="Noticeable expense—like a taxi fare, childcare costs, or short unpaid leave.">$$</span>
        Could be a barrier for some.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>High (A$50):</strong>
        <span class="icon-tooltip" title="Substantial cost—may require significant travel or more extended loss of work time.">$$$</span>
        Possibly a serious obstacle.

    <!-- Slide 8: Scenario Description -->
    <div class="slide" id="slide-8">
      <h2>The Scenario</h2>
      <p>
        Imagine a future pandemic caused by a new virus (not COVID‑19). Safe, effective vaccines are available. 
        Governments worldwide are deciding whether (and how) to mandate vaccination. 
        Each policy you’ll be shown uses the same vaccine but differs in its specifics—who’s covered, 
        when it starts and ends, exemptions, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        In each scenario, you’ll compare two mandates (A and B). Choose the one you prefer. 
        You’ll also be asked if you’d skip a mandate altogether if you had that option. 
        Your honest opinions will help us understand how these features shape willingness to accept a mandate.

          If you select <em>Mandate A</em>, you’re choosing a narrower scope, an early start threshold, 
          a lower vaccination target to lift, no incentives, strictly medical exemptions, and a small fee. 
          Next, you'd confirm if you'd switch to “no mandate” if it existed.
